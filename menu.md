# Thanksgiving 2013

The Poindexters

## Breakfast
* French Toast

	Inspired by an episode of *Brunch at Bobby's*, this thick-cut french toast can be modified to your heart's content, flavor-wise.

	Our dish will be influenced by the flavors of cinnamon and vanilla (real, not cheap extract), and served alongside turkey bacon for a tasty finish.

## Appetizers
* Grilled Shrimp

	A gradual progression of learning, I've landed on a quick, cheap, easy way to make flavor-packed grilled shrimp. Skewers, or not. Gas or charcoal. Marinated or not. It's an insanely flexible recipe.

	This edition will feature bold flavors of garlic, butter, a little dill, and fresh lime juice as a tangy garnish. Slow cooked over a pecan wood chip charcoal grill.

* Asparagus

	Another really easy, quick appetizer, although not necessarily cheap in quantiy out of season!

	This edition will feature strong flavors of butter, dill, and lemon, slow roasted over a cherry wood chip charcoal grill.

## Beverages
* Seasonal Beers
* Mimosas
* Sparkling Fruit Juice
* Wines, as available

## Main Course
* Roasted Cornish Hens

	A slight alternative for the Thanksgiving season, and a bit of a challenge. I calculated roughly 1.5 cornish hens for each placesetting.

	The goal here is simple flavor, and I really like the particular recipe the Neelys have put together. I may improvise a bit, but the power is in the perfect execution of technique, and proper prep (like most dishes I make).

## Side Dishes
* Mashed Red Potatoes

	This is one I've come to really REALLY enjoy, as have my kids. It's fast, it's cheap, it's damn tasty, and it's completely learned via trial and error over about 2 years time.

	The basics are that you've got 2 components: The wet and the "dry". The "dry" isn't actually dry, but it's your basic, skin on, cubed red potatoes, cooked until just done.

	The wet is where the power is. Take you a sauce pot. Add some milk, and slowly raise the heat on it. Add 1/2 to 1 stick of butter to it. Don't be scared, you're flavoring a LOT of potatoes if you cook how I do!

	Next, and the MOST important part... FINELY mince fresh garlic. How much? Who knows. I use about 1/2 head of garlic for my batches. Add that into this warm/hot mixture and just stir every now and then.

	Don't boil it! But do take off that skin on top, that's just gross. After it's set for a while, steeping, if you will, you use this to mix in the potatoes after you cook/drain/mash them. BAM. Flavor-packed mashed potatoes, skin-on, and kids love it!
